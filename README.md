# LandReg_py

This code takes shape files and data from a number of different sources and plots it using python

## Data Sources

The data has all been downloaded to my local PC but it can be found in the locations below. It is all UK data with an open government licence, or equivalent. I've found other shapefiles online but was unsure on their licence requirements so have not used them

+ National Statistics Postcode Lookup File [NSPL](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/)
+ Land Registry Price Paid data [PP_data](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads)
